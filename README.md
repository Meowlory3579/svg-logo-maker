# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that prompts the user to select a logo color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then saves the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Installation
Install Node.js, if needed.     

Create a .gitignore file and include "node_modules", ".vscode", and "package-lock.json" in it, so that these files aren't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.     

Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running "npm init" when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.     

This application requires the Inquirer.js module. To install inquirer, navigate to your terminal and enter "npm i inquirer@8.2.4".    

This application requires the Jest.js module. To install jest, navigate to your terminal and enter "npm i --save-dev jest".    

## Usage
Right-click on the "index.js" file and select "Open in Integrated Terminal". To initiate application, type "node index.js" and press enter. Complete the prompts to generate a README.md file.
